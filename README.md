Gathering and Using NCAA March Madness data (sql test project)

This repo is a compilation of my work to create a comprehensive database of player stats for the March Madness 2025 season.
Currently the plan is:


  -Scrape data from sprots.yahoo.com to create a .csv file for each game that is played in the tournament 

  
  -Create a database in SQL that will hold tables of data (unsure structure, but should include player stats by game such that a query can be run on a player who has played multiple games to get cumulative stats)

  
  -Write a .sh file to execute psql code to insert .csv data into SQL database

  
  -Migrate SQL database to Digital Ocean server

  
  -Build a website that allows users to find player and team stat that use some sort of backend query (learn node???)
